# Bangalore_Traffic_Insights

This project aims to visualize urban traffic patterns in Bangalore using an interactive R Shiny application. Bangalore is a densely populated metropolitan city with chronic traffic congestion. Through this project, we explore traffic patterns and investigate factors impacting congestion and travel time using a range of visual analytics. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns in the data that may help decision makers in finding data driven solutions to alleviate the traffic problem in the city
Our approach is rooted in storytelling through data. We designed our presentation and application in a logical sequence that starts with exploratory data visualizations to understand the dataset's structure and relationships. This is followed by a focus on compliance, traffic patterns, roadwork influence, year-on-year trends, and weather impact. This structured order was chosen to gradually shift from general traffic behavior to external and long-term influencing factors.
The final output is a functional, accessible web-based dashboard that empowers usersâ€”planners, residents, and analystsâ€”to explore Bangaloreâ€™s traffic dynamics visually.
